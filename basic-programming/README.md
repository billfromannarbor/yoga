# Basic Programming Examples Using Java script
Recursion [recursion.js] (./recursion.js) - countdown calls it's self until the number passed is less than 1
Variables [variables.js] (./variables.js) - Hoisting (let and const aren't, but var and functions are) and Strictly Equals (checks for type as well)
Sorting [sorting.js] (./sorting.js) - Uses a function to modify the standard sort
Arrow Functions [arrowfunctions.js] (./arrowfunctions.js) - Uses array.map to demonstrate how to replace a simple function with an arrow function.
