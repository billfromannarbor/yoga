- The Yoga project is intended to be experimental in nature.  The project will change on a frequent basis without notice.
- Testing of the code is done also on an experimental basis, so it is likely much of the code will not be fully tested. 
- Documentation of the code will be on an ad-hoc basis, again for experimentation only, the work will never be completely and professionally documented.
